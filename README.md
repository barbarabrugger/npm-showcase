# Readme

Showcase for QFS relevant topics around Node.js/npm/JavaScript/TypeScript...

## Getting started

```console

npm run start
curl localhost:3000
```

The following topics are already covered in this prototype:

- Logging
- Express.js (Webserver)

Other topics to be covered:

- Document generation
- The whole UI topic (React, ...)
- ...

Dependencies used in this project are documented in [dependencies](docs/vault/technology/dependencies).

## Documentation

There are some thoughts and documentation to various topics in the /docs subfolder. I recommend to start at [Mindset](/docs/vault/mindset) and then move on to the other topics.
