## Getting started

```

The following topics are already covered in this prototype:

Dependencies used in this project are documented in [dependencies](docs/vault/technology/dependencies).

## Documentation

There are some thoughts and documentation to various topics in the /docs subfolder. I recommend to start at [Philosophy](/docs/vault/philosophy) and then move on to the other topics.
