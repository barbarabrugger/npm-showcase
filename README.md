# Readme

Showcase for QFS relevant topics around Node.js/npm/JavaScript/TypeScript...

## Getting started

```console
npm i
npm run start
curl localhost:3000
```

Dependencies used in this project are documented in [tech-dependencies](docs/tech-dependencies.md).

## Documentation

There are some thoughts and documentation to various topics in the /docs subfolder. Each file has one of the following prefixes to indicate the topic:

- `mind`: Mindset
- `meth`: Methodology
- `tech`: Technology stack
- `tool`: Tooling

I recommend to start at [mind-start](docs/mind-start.md) and then move on to the other topics.
